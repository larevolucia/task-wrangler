# TaskWrangler

Many people feel overwhelmed when managing their to-do lists, making it difficult to stay motivated. Traditional to-do apps often overcomplicate things with excessive features while neglecting simplicity and motivation. As a result, these apps can become cumbersome to use, causing users to lose focus on their goals and abandon task management altogether.

**TaskWrangler** goes back to basics and is designed to be a simple, beginner-friendly to-do app aimed at making task management intuitive and motivating.

The app enables users to:

- Organize tasks effectively by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Organize tasks based on their status of completeness.
- Prioritize tasks by setting due dates and highlighting overdue items with visual cues.
- Track progress visually with insightful charts.

By focusing on simplicity, usability, and motivation, **TaskWrangler** empowers users to manage their tasks consistently without feeling overwhelmed.

## üìÇ Backlog

The following features were **originally planned** but were not implemented in this phase due to a shift in priorities. Instead, we focused on **enhancing the user experience** by introducing:
- **[Toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)** for better feedback.
- **[Keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)** for improved usability.

### **Features Not Implemented:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Motivational Quotes at Milestones** (The Juggler)  
- [As a user, I want motivational quotes at specific milestones to help keep me motivated.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/15)  
_This feature was **deprioritized** in favor of **[toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)**, which provide immediate feedback to users upon completing actions like adding or editing tasks._

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Task Categorization** (The Inspirer)  
- [As a user, I want to categorize my tasks so I can organize them by type or priority.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/13)  
 _Instead of implementing **categorization**, we focused on **[keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)**, making the app more inclusive and efficient for all users._

These features remain on the **backlog** for potential future development as **TaskWrangler** continues to evolve.

## üé® Design

### Colors

Considering primary function of the app is managing tasks, it was decided to keep with simple color scheme.
It was selected worldwide recognizable colors for tracking progress: green, yellow, red.

For the base of the app, a neutral blue was chosen, since it is a calming color that doesn't clash with the traffic light scheme.
A white hex was selected for the background and a black hex was selected for the text color.

</details>


### Fonts

For TaskWrangler, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was selected as the primary font, used for the body text and logo, and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as the secondary font for headings and toast notifications to optimize readability and maintain a clean, modern asthetic.

### Why Inter for Body & Logo?
- Highly readable for long-form text, ensuring tasks and descriptions are easy to scan.
- Modern and neutral, fitting TaskWrangler‚Äôs minimalist design.
- Strong identity when used in the logo, reinforcing brand consistency.

### Why Roboto for Headings & Toast Notifications?
- Bold and structured, making H1 and H2 stand out for clear visual hierarchy.
- Slightly condensed design, optimizing space for notifications without reducing legibility.
- Pairs well with Inter, balancing a clean UI with strong contrast where needed.

## üöÄ Features



### **1. Navigation**

Provides a clean and accessible navigation system for seamless interaction with the app. Users can easily create tasks, view task lists, and access insights.

- **Focus management:** Uses `document.activeElement` tracking to return focus to the last interacted element after closing modals.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Supports `Tab` key navigation across buttons, links, and modals.
- **ARIA attributes:** Ensures screen reader compatibility with `aria-labelledby`, `role="list"`, and `aria-live` for live updates.
- **Sticky Navigation:** The header remains fixed at the top using `position: sticky`, improving accessibility.

### **2. Create Tasks with Ease**

Allows users to add new tasks with essential details such as **title, description, and due date**.

- **Modal Form Implementation:** Task creation is handled within a dynamically generated modal.
- **Form Validation:** 
  - Ensures **title is required** before submission.
  - Prevents **past due dates** using `min="${getTodayDate()}"`.
  - Displays **error messages** using JavaScript.
- **LocalStorage Integration:** 
  - Tasks are stored in `localStorage` and retrieved on page load.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - `Enter` key submission for faster input.
  - `Escape` key to close the form.


### **3. Task Management (CRUD)**

#### **3.1 Task List View**

Displays all tasks in **card format**, each showing **status, due date, and action buttons**.

- **Dynamic HTML Generation:** Tasks are rendered dynamically using `innerHTML` within `#tasks-container`.
- **Accessibility Features:** 
  - Uses `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` for semantic structuring.
  - `aria-labelledby` links task titles to their containers for screen readers.
- **Overdue Task Highlighting:**
  - If a task‚Äôs due date is past today‚Äôs date, the task is assigned an `overdue` class that applies a red color.

#### **3.2 Read Task Details**

- Clicking a task card opens a modal displaying **status, description, and due date**.
- Implemented using a dynamically created `div` inside `#content-container`.
- Read view also includes action buttons to minimize back and forth on the UI.
- Uses **`trapFocus()` function** to lock focus within the modal.

#### **3.3 Edit Task**

- Users can **update title, description, status, and due date**.
- **Previous values:** Pre-fills form with task current values for users convenience.
- **Prevent Unnecessary updates:** Compares current and new values before updating `localStorage` and sends notification of use cases (edit success, no edits).
- **Prevent Overdue Edits:** 
  - If a task is overdue, past dates are still allowed for consistency. Earliest date is set to original due date using `min=${currentTask[0].dueDate}`.
- **Auto-save on Submit:** Updates **localStorage** and **UI** without page reload.

#### **3.4 Delete Task**

- **Confirmation Modal:** Before deletion, users receive a confirmation prompt.
- **Persistent Storage Update:** Task is removed from `localStorage`, and UI is updated dynamically.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Supports `Enter` key selection and `Escape` key to cancel.

### **4. Smart Toast Notifications**

Provides real-time feedback on task actions such as **creation, updates, and deletions**.

- **Dynamic Toast Generation:** 
  - Uses `document.createElement("div")` to create toast containers dynamically.
- **Auto-dismissal:** 
  - Uses `setTimeout()` to remove notifications after 5 seconds.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:**
  - `Tab` focusable and closable using `Escape` key.
- **Color-coded Feedback:**
  - **Success (green)**: Task added successfully.
  - **Error (red)**: Failed to save task.
  - **Info (blue)**: Info about action.
  - **Warning (yellow)**: Missing required fields.

###  **5. Advanced Keyboard Navigation**

- **Tab Trapping:** `trapFocus()` ensures users can only navigate within an open modal.
- **Escape Key Handling:** `handleEscapeKey()` allows quick modal closing.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - `Enter` submits forms and confirms actions.
  - `Tab` cycles through interactive elements.

## **6. Insights & Analytics (Task Progress Charts)**

Uses **Google Charts API** to visualize task progress.

### **6.1 Status Breakdown Chart**

- **Pie Chart Representation** of tasks categorized as **To-Do, In Progress, and Done**.
- **Data Fetching:** Reads `localStorage` and processes counts via `reduce()`.
- **Color Coding:** Uses same colors used on task cards for consistency.
  - **To-Do (yellow)**
  - **In Progress (blue)**
  - **Done (green)**
- Dynamically updates as tasks are added/edited.

### **6.2 Overdue Task Analysis**

- **Overdue vs On-Time Tasks Pie Chart**
- Highlights overdue tasks in **red** and on-time tasks in **green**.
- Dynamically updates as tasks are added/edited.

### **6.3 Responsive Charts**

- **Auto-resizes on window resize** using `window.addEventListener("resize", drawCharts)`.
- Charts adapt to screen size, maintaining clarity.

---

## **Additional Enhancements**
- **LocalStorage Integration:** 
  - Tasks persist between sessions without requiring a backend.
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Catches `JSON.parse()` failures and resets `localStorage` to prevent app crashes.
- **ARIA Compliance:** 
  - Uses `aria-live="polite"` for toast notifications to be screen reader-friendly.
  - `aria-labelledby` ensures task descriptions are properly linked.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** 
  - No external dependencies beyond Google Charts API.
