## Summary

Many people feel overwhelmed when managing their to-do lists, making it difficult to stay motivated. Traditional to-do apps often overcomplicate things with excessive features while neglecting simplicity and motivation. As a result, these apps can become cumbersome to use, causing users to lose focus on their goals and abandon task management altogether.

**TaskWrangler** goes back to basics and is designed to be a simple, beginner-friendly to-do app aimed at making task management intuitive and motivating.

The app enables users to:

- Organize tasks effectively by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Organize tasks based on their status of completeness.
- Prioritize tasks by setting due dates and highlighting overdue items with visual cues.
- Track progress visually with insightful charts.

By focusing on simplicity, usability, and motivation, **TaskWrangler** empowers users to manage their tasks consistently without feeling overwhelmed.

## üìÇ Backlog

The following features were **originally planned** but were not implemented in this phase due to a shift in priorities. Instead, we focused on **enhancing the user experience** by introducing:
- **[Toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)** for better feedback.
- **[Keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)** for improved usability.
- **[Update Status From Task List](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/39)** for improved usability.

### **Features Not Implemented:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Motivational Quotes at Milestones** (The Juggler)  
- [As a user, I want motivational quotes at specific milestones to help keep me motivated.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/15)  
_This feature was **deprioritized** in favor of **[toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)**, which provide immediate feedback to users upon completing actions like adding or editing tasks._

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Task Categorization** (The Inspirer)  
- [As a user, I want to categorize my tasks so I can organize them by type or priority.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/13)  
 _Instead of implementing **categorization**, we focused on **[keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)**, making the app more inclusive and efficient for all users._


These features remain on the **backlog** for potential future development as **TaskWrangler** continues to evolve.

## üé® Design

### Colors

Considering the primary function of the app is managing tasks, it was decided to keep with simple color scheme.
Worldwide recognizable colors were selected for tracking progress: green, yellow, red.

For the base of the app, a neutral blue was chosen, since it is a calming color that doesn't clash with the traffic light scheme.
A white hex was selected for the background and a black hex was selected for the text color.

</details>


### Fonts

For TaskWrangler, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was selected as the primary font, used for the body text and logo, and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as the secondary font for headings and toast notifications to optimize readability and maintain a clean, modern aesthetic.

### Why Inter for Body & Logo?
- Highly readable for long-form text, ensuring tasks and descriptions are easy to scan.
- Modern and neutral, fitting TaskWrangler‚Äôs minimalist design.
- Strong identity when used in the logo, reinforcing brand consistency.

### Why Roboto for Headings & Toast Notifications?
- Bold and structured, making H1 and H2 stand out for clear visual hierarchy.
- Slightly condensed design, optimizing space for notifications without reducing legibility.
- Pairs well with Inter, balancing a clean UI with strong contrast where needed.

- **Commit:** [f95a81a](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/f95a81a7cc4869bd900c5c6174e99f6cedda234a), [f61438d](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/f61438dc3beaaef97eecc4472bead4f5403df4cf), [48715dd](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/48715dd19a1dee46c783ba1509f1e0f43ee0ea49), [97461cf](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/97461cf605b2bcc0ceebfac847c25f4cd7d2db0f)

### 11. DueDate line break on Overdue Task
- **Issue:** [#35](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/35)
- **Summary of Fix:** Adjusted the CSS adding a `min-width` to prevent line breaks in the due date display for overdue tasks, ensuring the date appears on a single line.

### 12. Last focused element lost after Toast Notification / Delete task
- **Issue:** [#30](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/30)
- **Summary of Fix:** Initial fix implemented `tabindex` to contentContainer element and directed the focus to that element after delete. Later that was moved to taskListContainer. Final fix moved the notifications code to an idenpendent js file and introduce parameters for `lastFocusedEl` and a `fallbackFocusEl`. The new parameters allowed more flexibility to define behavior in different scenarios and prepares for further use when scaling the application.

### 13. Focus resets to taskListContainer
- **Issue:** [#37](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/37)
- **Summary of Fix:** Explicit reset of focus on closeModal and closeToast resets the focus even after user has navigated to other elements using tab. Conditional was added at the end of each function to check if the focus was already on a valid element, preventing explicit reset after user navigated elsewhere.

### 14. Multiple Empty Task List messages on Insights page
- **Issue:** [#38](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/38)
- **Summary of Fix:** Added conditional to `handleEmptyInsights` to only append message if the message doesn't already exists.
- **Commit:** [03716e9](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/03716e99e5868b31425faaf4ef9ae0d251769bc1)

## Unfixed issues

 ### 1. Jigsaw warnings: Font Imports and variables
- **Issue:** [#26](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/26)
- **Justification:** It's common practice to use imports for fonts and variables for styling.

### 2. WAVE alerts: Redundant link: Adjacent links go to the same URL
- **Issue:** [#33](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/33)
- **Justification:** It's common practice for logo to also redirect to home.

### 3. Error loading charts
- **Issue:** [#36](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/36)
- **Summary of Fix:** DataTable was undefined when loading the screen. I couldn't fix it, but to mitigate it, I added a try...catch to prevent app from crashing. Error seems non-critical as the charts eventually do load without crashing. Common user is unlikely to notice any issue.
- **Commit:** [d664ec4](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/commit/d664ec4fc6d28419e00a779878d636350cf0bddc)
