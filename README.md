# TaskWrangler

Many people feel overwhelmed when managing their to-do lists, making it difficult to stay motivated. Traditional to-do apps often overcomplicate things with excessive features while neglecting simplicity and motivation. As a result, these apps can become cumbersome to use, causing users to lose focus on their goals and abandon task management altogether.

**TaskWrangler** goes back to basics and is designed to be a simple, beginner-friendly to-do app aimed at making task management intuitive and motivating.

The app enables users to:

- Organize tasks effectively by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Organize tasks based on their status of completeness.
- Prioritize tasks by setting due dates and highlighting overdue items with visual cues.
- Track progress visually with insightful charts.

By focusing on simplicity, usability, and motivation, **TaskWrangler** empowers users to manage their tasks consistently without feeling overwhelmed.

## üìÇ Backlog

The following features were **originally planned** but were not implemented in this phase due to a shift in priorities. Instead, we focused on **enhancing the user experience** by introducing:
- **[Toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)** for better feedback.
- **[Keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)** for improved usability.

### **Features Not Implemented:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Motivational Quotes at Milestones** (The Juggler)  
- [As a user, I want motivational quotes at specific milestones to help keep me motivated.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/15)  
_This feature was **deprioritized** in favor of **[toast notifications](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/23)**, which provide immediate feedback to users upon completing actions like adding or editing tasks._

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Task Categorization** (The Inspirer)  
- [As a user, I want to categorize my tasks so I can organize them by type or priority.](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/13)  
 _Instead of implementing **categorization**, we focused on **[keyboard accessibility](https://github.com/larevolucia/task-wrangler/issues/17)**, making the app more inclusive and efficient for all users._

These features remain on the **backlog** for potential future development as **TaskWrangler** continues to evolve.

## üé® Design

### Colors

Considering primary function of the app is managing tasks, it was decided to keep with simple color scheme.
It was selected worldwide recognizable colors for tracking progress: green, yellow, red.

For the base of the app, a neutral blue was chosen, since it is a calming color that doesn't clash with the traffic light scheme.
A white hex was selected for the background and a black hex was selected for the text color.

### Fonts

For TaskWrangler, [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was selected as the primary font, used for the body text and logo, and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as the secondary font for headings and toast notifications to optimize readability and maintain a clean, modern asthetic.

### Why Inter for Body & Logo?
- Highly readable for long-form text, ensuring tasks and descriptions are easy to scan.
- Modern and neutral, fitting TaskWrangler‚Äôs minimalist design.
- Strong identity when used in the logo, reinforcing brand consistency.

### Why Roboto for Headings & Toast Notifications?

- Pairs well with Inter, balancing a clean UI with strong contrast where needed.
